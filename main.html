<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is important to ensure that the algorithm is efficient.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by the algorithm to complete its execution. It can be expressed as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing resource usage.</p>
